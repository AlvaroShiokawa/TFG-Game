- Language used: Javascript
- Platforms supported: ANYTHING that can run HTML5 and Javascript... For God's Sake lol... Jokes aside, this game was tested on Google Chrome version 51.0.2704.19 dev-m (64-bit).
- Creation date: April, 7th, 2016
- How to run: Open the "index.html" file
- A racing game I contributed with, collaborating with ADRIAN SHIOKAWA ALVAREZ, in which you, as a player, control a car (A fancy looking white Lamborghini), which speed gradually, but constantly, increases, as a way to increase difficulty.
- Your score keeps increasing over time, so aim for a high score!
- You can only move your car LEFT or RIGHT, by using the respective keyboard arrow keys.
- There are three types of obstacles: Holes, Oil Puddles and Cars.
--- If your car touches a hole, you lose 50 points.
--- If your car touches an oil puddle, it is gonna slip randomly, either to your left or to your right, definetely making you lose control of your car.
--- Last, if you hit another car, BOOM, you DIE and it is Game Over (Yes, sucks to be you).
- All graphics, music and sounds belong to their respective owners! So, credits were properly given!
- OBS: Props to SEGA for making such marvelous music!
